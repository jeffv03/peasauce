INTELLIGENT DISASSEMBLING
=========================

For a given address, the "intelligent" logic disassembles instruction after instruction
as a sequence, until it is no longer able to do so.

This is because of three possible reasons:

1. The end of the current memory space is reached.
2. Unrecognisable data is encountered.
3. A final instruction is reached (branch, jump, return, etc).

After this, the matched instructions are processed for addresses in their operands.

Two types of addresses can be found:

1. Branch addresses.
2. Reference addresses.

RELOCATIBLE FILES
-----------------

BINARY FILES
------------

There's a lot more room for ambiguity.
Imm values (#xxx) cannot be assumed to be references if they fall within known address spaces.

SCRIPTABLE ACTION SYSTEM
------------------------

Listed in the functionality todo section:
- Undo/redo.

How to do this?  Stack?  Actions with parameters?

GENERAL NOTES

- OPERAND SELECTION IN THE CURRENTLY SELECTED ROW
  The first implementation of the operand selection code required explicit
  selection of an operand.  Pressing 1, 2, or 3 would put an operand selection
  in place for the currently selected row.
  - BUG: In the operand selection code, where it doesn't seem to work
    for every row.  Fix that first.
	- RESOLUTION: Was trying to repaint the given row for the selection, and it
	  wasn't working doing model.update() calls.  Switched to emitting
	  dataChanged events, which appears to work.
  - Bind left and right cursor keys to toggling operand selection.
  - When moving between rows, the first operand (if there is one) of the newly
    selected row is automatically selected.
- KEYBOARD CONTROL
  Ideally it should be possible to control the program using just the
  keyboard.  I've hooked up the space key, on the uncertain data control
  window to show the context menu.
  - BUG: Get focus on uncertain data references, and press space, and then
    then labelise a value.  The focus will not be returned to the table,
	and the table will have some weird dotted line per-cell selection mode.
	- RESOLUTION: None known, focus switches to main disassembly window at the
	  moment, which hides the problem as next focus of the uncertain data
	  references window generally is done by selecting a row.

- TABLE SELECTION
  Selection for the disassembly table was per-cell, but there was no obvious
  benefit from it, given that it included use of the left and right cursor
  keys, which might be more natural fits for operand selection.

- When I see a block which is one data type, and I want to know why it was
  created as there are no references to it, to jump to, I want to be able
  to view information about it.
  - Inserting a symbol, should note metadata about it's automatic creation.
- Need to write a new save file migration, from version 4 to 5.
  - Relocated addresses is now a dictionary, with a list of what
